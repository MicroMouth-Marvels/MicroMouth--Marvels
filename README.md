# Effects of probiotic mouthwash on the oral microbiome health. 

## Overview
This file contains an in-depth analysis from the data obtained from experiment carried on a probiotic mouthwash on market using PH testing, Gum bleeding and Plaque as our experimental protocols. 

## Purpose
The analysis aims to determine the effectiveness of the probiotic mouthwash in maintaining the health of the oral microbiome. 

## Methodology
The analysis includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Statistical analysis.
- Visualization of data
- Dashboard preparation

## Files Used
PH.ipynb
Panel_DSPH.ipynb
Gum_bleeding_interactive.ipynb
Gum_bleeding_plt.ipynb
Main.ipynb
Mouth.datascience_1.ipynb
Plaque.ipynb

## Analysis
Data Inspection: Examining dataset structure, missing values, and data types
Visualization: Utilizing histograms, scatter plots, and box plots for data exploration
Statistical Tests: MannWhitney test, AndersonDarling test, Q_Q_Plot,Mcmenar's test, Wilcoxon-sign-ranked test

## Conclusion
The analysis reveals there was not a significant change in PH values, gum bleeding and plaque values amongst all participants after the use of the probiotic mouthwash based on the individual pvalues obtained from the various protocols before and after the test period. However, there was a significant change in gum bleeding values when the responses of all the participants are put together based on the pvalues obtained after the use the probiotic mouthwash.This shows that probiotic mouthwash used did have little or no effect on maintaining the health of the oral microbiome.
